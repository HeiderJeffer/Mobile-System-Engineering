# Online and offline catalog/order 
The user can see the catalog of pens offline and add to cart even if there is no internet because all the details are stored locally either using the local Room database or shared preferences. However, to successfully make a payment and make a valid order the user needs the internet connection to connect to the third-party payment processor servers, in our case, Stripe.

# Integration Stripe payment
We connect to the Stripe api using secure tokenized communication and request for payment charges, done on the server side, and then receive the information back to the client side and display appropriate messages.
Shopping cart The user can add to the cart which does not involve an external database connection and so it is completely offline, the user can go to the checkout page and see the list of items added to the cart.

# Google authentication
To configure a Google API Console project, click the button "CONFIGURE A PROJECT" [at: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating] to Configure a project for Google Sign-in, and specify your app's package name when prompted. You will also need to provide the SHA-1 hash of your signing certificate. See Authenticating Your Client for information. 

# Linux Another Extra level of Security
We create  Superuser folder (root: ‘sudo su’ then ‘./studio.sh’ or sudo -i then ‘studio.sh’) to run the project, online compiler is off and online Gradle is off .These steps are so important to avoid or at least to minimize the Data-Collection, Spayware, Buggies Android Update and other dirty crape made by Google Devs and Google’s partners.
